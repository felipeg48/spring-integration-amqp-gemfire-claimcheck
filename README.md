Claimcheck pattern with vFabric RabbitMQ and Gemfire
====================================================

In this project, I will demo Spring Integration, vFabric RabbitMQ and Gemfire to demo Claimcheck pattern. 

To quickly see how it works,

* Run "mvn test" to see all the tests work. 

If you want to do End to End testing follow the steps below.

	Set ERLANG_HOME=[ERLang install location]

* Install [RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com/releases/rabbitmq-server/v2.8.7/rabbitmq-server-2.8.7.exe)
